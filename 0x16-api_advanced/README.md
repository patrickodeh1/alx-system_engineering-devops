# 0x16. API Advanced

## Project Overview
This project focuses on making API calls using Python, particularly with the Reddit API. The tasks involve querying endpoints, handling pagination, parsing JSON data, and implementing recursive functions. It is designed to help develop skills essential for working with APIs, which is a common requirement in technical interviews and real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Read and understand API documentation.
- Make API calls with pagination.
- Parse JSON responses.
- Implement recursive API calls.
- Sort dictionaries by value.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3 or higher
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use the Requests module to interact with the Reddit API
- All Python files should be executable, have organized imports, and include a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/python3`)

## Key Tasks

1. **How many subs?**
   - Query the Reddit API to return the number of subscribers for a given subreddit.

2. **Top Ten**
   - Print the titles of the first 10 hot posts for a given subreddit.

3. **Recurse it!**
   - Use recursion to return a list of all hot article titles for a given subreddit.

4. **Count it!** (Advanced)
   - Parse the titles of all hot articles and print a sorted count of specific keywords in descending order.
